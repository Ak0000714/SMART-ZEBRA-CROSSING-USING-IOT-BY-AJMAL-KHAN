SCOPE OF THE PROJECT 
The "Smart Zebra Crossing" project involves assembling hardware  components like the Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, and LED lights, and  developing software algorithms to manage these elements. The system will  be integrated and tested for accuracy and ease of use, especially for  vulnerable groups such as the elderly and students. After deployment at  selected crossings, continuous monitoring will assess its impact on  pedestrian safety and compliance.
RESULT:
Reduction in Accidents:The system led to a measurable decrease in  traffic accidents at zebra crossings where it was installed, indicating  improved safety for pedestrians
.Increased Driver Awareness:Drivers 
responded effectively to the  LED signals, with fewer instances of non-compliance, enhancing  overall road safety.
Effective Pedestrian Detection:The ultrasonic sensor reliably  detected pedestrians and other objects within the defined range,  ensuring timely activation of the LED signals.
Enhanced System Visibility:Multicolor LED lights provided high  visibility both day and night, making the crossing more noticeable to  drivers and pedestrians from a distance.
The "Smart Zebra Crossing" project improved pedestrian safety by  using Arduino technology and LED lights to detect pedestrians and  adjust traffic signals. This led to fewer accidents, better driver  compliance, and increased visibility. Positive feedback from users,  including those with disabilities, highlights its effectiveness. The  system shows promise for broader urban use.
